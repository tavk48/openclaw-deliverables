2026-02-06: Started development of the core features for the productivity hub app, emphasizing task management and session recaps. Focused on scalability for future features.

2026-02-06: Created and deployed Productivity Hub — a personal productivity system with 5 components:
- Task Manager (active/backlog/done workflow)
- Session Summaries (auto-generated work recaps)
- Project Dashboards (StageVibe, Web Dev, AgencySpotter)
- Decision Log (timestamped choices with rationale)
- Handoff Protocol (quick context restoration)

Built with Next.js + TypeScript, data stored as Markdown for Git version control.
