# Web Development - No-Response Email Sequence

## Context
Follow-up sequence for prospects who received a free demo site but didn't respond or commit. Addresses the core pain point: demos don't close due to weak follow-up.

## EMAIL 1: The Value Reminder (Day 2 after demo)

**Subject:** Your demo site is ready — quick thoughts?

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Hope this week is treating you well. I wanted to circle back on the demo site I built for [Business Name].

No pressure at all — I know you're juggling a million things. But I did want to mention something: the site is just sitting there, ready to go live whenever you want. It already has:

- Mobile-friendly design (60+ percent of your customers search on phones)
- Fast loading (helps with Google rankings)
- Your branding and contact info locked in

If there's anything you'd like adjusted before going live, just let me know. Or if you've decided to hold off for now, that's totally fine too — just wanted to make sure you didn't miss it.

Either way, I'll follow up once more in a few days and then close out your file so I'm not bugging you.

Best,

## EMAIL 2: The Social Proof + Scarcity (Day 5 after demo)

**Subject:** One more thing about your site (then I'll drop it)

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Quick follow-up — this is my last reach-out about the demo site.

I wanted to share something: I just launched a site for another [industry] business in [nearby city] last week. They told me they got 3 new customer inquiries in the first 4 days from people finding them on Google.

I built yours the same way. Same structure, same optimization, just customized for your business.

Here's the thing: I'm shifting focus to a new batch of projects next week, so if you do want to move forward with your site, now's the time. If I don't hear back, I'll assume timing isn't right and close out your file — no hard feelings, and you're welcome to reach out anytime in the future.

Either way, best of luck with [Business Name].

## EMAIL 3: The Final Check + Door Opener (Day 8 after demo)

**Subject:** Closing your file — one last thought

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Per my last email, I'm closing out your file today. Not ghosting you — just keeping my pipeline organized.

Real talk: Most businesses I talk to who don't move forward either (A) don't actually need a new site right now, or (B) got busy and forgot.

If it's B, just hit reply with "still interested" and I'll pick this back up. If it's A, no worries at all — I appreciate you taking the time to look at the demo.

Your site files will stay on my server for another 30 days, then they'll auto-delete. If you change your mind before then, just reach out.

Thanks again for considering me for this.
