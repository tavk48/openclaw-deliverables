# Web Development - Cold Voicemail Script

## Context
Voicemail script for Google Maps prospecting. Left when prospect doesn't answer cold call. Designed to get callback through curiosity + value promise.

---

## PRIMARY SCRIPT (30 seconds)

"Hey [Name], this is Tristan Velez. I work with local businesses in [City] on their websites.

[Business Name] came up in my research this week. Looked like your site might not be showing up for people searching for [service] in the area.

I build fast, mobile-friendly websites specifically for [industry] businesses. Takes about a week, and I'm local — not some overseas call center.

If you want to see what I'd build for you — no obligation — just Google '[Business Name] demo site' and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

Or call me back at [Phone]. Again, Tristan Velez, [Phone]."

## VOICEMAIL + TEXT FOLLOWUP (IMMEDIATE)

After leaving voicemail, send this text within 60 seconds:

---

**Text Message:**

"Hi [Name], just left you a voicemail about a free demo site I built for [Business Name]. No obligation — just want you to see what your competition is doing online. Check it out: [LINK]. Call or text back if you want to discuss. - Tristan"

---

## VARIATION: SHORT VERSION (20 seconds)

"Hey [Name], Tristan Velez here. Saw [Business Name] while researching local [industry] companies. Built you a demo website — see it at [link] or just search your business name + 'demo site.' Call me back at [Phone] if it catches your interest."

---

## VARIATION: REFERRAL ANGLE
n"Hey [Name], Tristan Velez calling from [City]. One of your competitors mentioned you might be looking at updating your online presence. Built a quick demo for [Business Name] — check it when you get a sec. [LINK]. Call me back at [Phone] if you want to talk through it."

## DELIVERY NOTES

**Tone:**
- Conversational, not salesy
- Speak like you're talking to a peer, not pitching
- Slight pause between sentences (leave space to breathe)
- Don't read — practice first, then deliver naturally

**Timing:**
- Call between 10 AM - 12 PM or 2 PM - 4 PM
- Tuesday-Thursday best (Monday busy, Friday checked out)
- Leave voicemail only if rings 4+ times or goes to message immediately

**Follow-Up Sequence:**
- Day 0: Cold call + voicemail + text
- Day 2: Email with demo link
- Day 5: Second call (no voicemail)
- Day 7: Final email

**Optimization:**
- Track which script variation gets callbacks
- A/B test: Short vs. Long version
- Test different hooks ("competitors mentioned you" vs. "saw your business")

## REMEMBER

The goal of a voicemail is NOT to sell. It's to get ONE thing: a callback or a click to the demo site.

Once they see the demo, the site does the selling for you.
