# Web Development - A/B Text Message Templates

## Context
SMS templates for cold outreach follow-up. Sent immediately after leaving voicemail. A/B testing different angles: value vs. urgency vs. curiosity.

---

## VERSION A: Value-First (Control)

**Text:**
"Hi [Name], just left you a voicemail about a free demo site I built for [Business Name]. No obligation — just want you to see what your competition is doing online. Check it out: [LINK]. Call or text back if you want to discuss. - Tristan"

**Tone:** Helpful, low pressure
**Hook:** "What competition is doing"
**CTA:** Soft (call or text back)

---

## VERSION B: Curiosity Gap

**Text:**
"Hi [Name], built something for [Business Name] this week. Searched for [service] in [City] and couldn't find you on page 1. Made you a demo showing how to fix that: [LINK]. Takes 2 min to see. - Tristan"

**Tone:** Problem-aware, direct
**Hook:** "Couldn't find you"
**CTA:** Specific (takes 2 min)

---

## VERSION C: Social Proof + Scarcity

**Text:**
"Hi [Name], Tristan here. Just launched a site for [nearby business] and they already got [X] calls from Google. Built [Business Name] a demo too: [LINK]. I'm taking on 3 more clients this month — reply if interested. - Tristan"

**Tone:** Results-focused, limited availability
**Hook:** Competitor success
**CTA:** Exclusivity (3 spots)

---

## VERSION D: Direct Ask

**Text:**
"Hi [Name], Tristan with web dev. Saw [Business Name] on Google Maps. Your site isn't mobile-friendly — 60% of customers bounce. I fixed it in a demo: [LINK]. Want to see it? Reply YES and I'll call you. - Tristan"

**Tone:** Consultative, problem-solution
**Hook:** Specific stat (60% bounce)
**CTA:** Binary (reply YES)

---

## VERSION E: The "Wrong Number" Angle

**Text:**
"Hi [Name], this is Tristan. Was looking for [service] in [City] and couldn't find [Business Name] easily online. Built you a quick fix just to show what's possible: [LINK]. Call me if you want to talk through it: [PHONE]."

**Tone:** Accidental discovery
**Hook:** "Couldn't find you easily"
**CTA:** Direct phone number

## TESTING PROTOCOL

**How to A/B Test:**
1. Divide 100 prospects into 5 groups of 20
2. Send each group a different version
3. Track:
   - Response rate (replies received)
   - Click-through rate (link visits)
   - Conversion rate (calls booked)
   - Time to response

**Success Metrics:**
- Response rate target: 10-20%
- Click-through target: 30-40%
- Call booking target: 2-5%

**Determining Winner:**
- Primary metric: CALLS BOOKED (not just replies)
- Secondary metric: Response rate
- Test minimum: 20 sends per variant before declaring winner
