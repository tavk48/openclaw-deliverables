## MUSICIAN OUTREACH

### Template A: Direct Value Proposition

**Subject:** Tool for musicians — tips + song requests via QR

**Email:**
Hi [Name],

I saw you perform at [Venue] recently. Quick question: are you currently collecting tips digitally, or just cash in a jar?

I'm Tristan, and I built StageVibe for local musicians. It's a simple QR code system where your audience can:
- Tip you directly (no venue cut)
- See your song list and request songs
- Leave without "forgetting" to visit Venmo later

Demo video: [LINK]

Takes 2 minutes to set up. No app downloads, no fees.

Worth a look?

### Template B: The Problem First

**Subject:** Are you losing tips to "I'll Venmo you later?"

**Email:**
Hi [Name],

I track with local musicians in Bradenton/Sarasota. One thing keeps coming up: fans say "I'll catch you on Venmo after the show," then don't.

StageVibe fixes that. QR code on your mic stand or table → audience taps → tips you immediately + can request songs.

No friction. They don't need the app. Just scan and go.

Set up free: stagevibe.io/setup

Let me know if you want to test it at your next gig.

Best,
Tristan

### Template C: Social Proof

**Subject:** [Musician Name] used this at [Venue] — $340 in tips

**Email:**
Hi [Name],

Wanted to share a quick win: [Musician Name] used StageVibe at [Venue] last month and pulled in $340 in tips from just 87 scans.

Why it worked:
- QR code at every table
- Song request feature kept people engaged
- Tips went direct to them (not through venue)

If you're playing around Bradenton/Sarasota and want to test it, I can get you set up this week.

## VENUE MANAGER OUTREACH

### Template D: The Pitch to Venue

**Subject:** Better tips for your musicians = better draw

**Email:**
Hi [Name],

I'm Tristan, local to Bradenton. I build tools for musicians and came across [Venue Name].

Quick thought: musicians who make more money from tips play harder, promote more, and draw bigger crowds.

StageVibe is a QR-code system that lets your customers tip musicians AND request songs in real-time. No hardware, no app installs.

Your musicians make more. Your customers stay longer. No downside.

Want me to send a one-pager or do a quick 5-min call?

### Template E: The Revenue Angle

**Subject:** Adding revenue stream for [Venue Name] musicians

**Email:**
Hi [Name],

Most venues don't think about how musicians get paid beyond the guarantee. But when musicians make good tips, they:
- Promote their gigs harder
- Draw repeat customers
- Stay loyal to your venue

StageVibe lets customers tip musicians via QR code + request songs. Musicians love it. Takes zero effort from your staff.

One of your competitors in Sarasota is testing it now. Happy to share results.

Interested?

"Hi [Name] — saw you play at [Venue]. Question: are you capturing tips digitally or just cash? I built something that might help. 2-min setup. Worth a look?"

## PHONE SCRIPT (Musicians)

**Goal:** 2-minute call, get them to look at demo.

"Hey [Name], this is Tristan. I'm a local developer who built StageVibe — it's a QR code system for musicians to take tips and song requests.

Wanted to ask: at your gigs, are you mostly getting cash tips or digital ones?

[pause for answer]

Got it. The thing I kept hearing from musicians is fans say 'I'll Venmo you later' and then don't. This puts the tip button right in front of them while they're still feeling the music.

Mind if I text you a 30-second demo video? You can see if it fits your setup.

[take yes, get number, send immediately]

Thanks [Name], I'll send that now. Hit me back if you have questions."
