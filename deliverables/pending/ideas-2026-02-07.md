# Today's Viral Product Idea: ShowUp.ai

## The Product
ShowUp.ai is an AI-powered Google Business Profile (GBP) automation tool built specifically for local service businesses. It automatically requests reviews from customers after service completion, generates personalized AI responses to every review (positive or negative), schedules GBP posts to keep the business active, and provides a simple dashboard showing local SEO performance metrics. In short: it makes invisible local businesses impossible to ignore.

## The Problem
Local service businesses (plumbers, roofers, handymen, cleaners, small contractors) rely almost entirely on word-of-mouth—but they're digitally invisible. They have few reviews, never respond to existing ones, and rarely post updates. Their Google Business Profiles are ghost towns despite being their most important marketing asset. They know they "should do something" but have no time or knowledge. The result? They lose leads daily to bigger competitors with better online presence.

## Why It Goes Viral
- **Instant gratification**: Users see their review count climb within days, not months
- **Shareable wins**: Every business owner brags when they hit 50+ reviews; the tool becomes the reason for their success story
- **Visible improvement**: GBP profiles transform from empty to active – tangible, public proof
- **Network effect**: Winning inspires neighboring businesses in the same trade/area to sign up
- **Built-in case studies**: Before/after screenshots of GBP profiles are compelling social proof

## Launch Strategy (Alex Finn Model)

**Pre-launch:**
- Create "The 30-Day GBP Challenge" – free email course teaching local businesses to optimize their Google presence
- Build waitlist targeting Tristan's existing web dev prospects (they already trust him)
- Share "GBP audit" walkthroughs on TikTok/IG showing how bad most local profiles are (entertainment + education)
- Partner with 5 local businesses for free beta in exchange for video testimonials
- Create FOMO: "Only taking 50 beta users in [city name]"

**Launch day:**
- Post "I built this in 48 hours" thread showing the problem and solution
- Live demo requests livestream: "Drop your business type, I'll show you exactly how many reviews you're losing"
- Email waitlist with founder "I built this for my dad's roofing company" story
- ProductHunt launch with before/after case studies from beta users

**Platforms:**
- TikTok/IG Reels: Short audits of local businesses (humor + value)
- LinkedIn: Long-form posts about "the invisible tax on local businesses"
- Twitter/X: "GBP hot takes" and threads on local SEO misconceptions
- YouTube: Full tutorials and case study deep-dives

**Content hooks:**
- "The $50,000 mistake every roofer makes on Google"
- "I audited 100 local plumbers. Here is why they're broke."
- "This one setting costs handymen 3 clients per week"
- "The review response trick that doubled this cleaner's calls"

## Build Specs

## Monetization

**Pricing model:**

**Target first $1K timeline:**
Week 2 of launch: 20 Starter subscribers ($580) + 6 Pro subscribers ($474) = $1,054 MRR
Realistic with warm waitlist from existing web dev pipeline

## Target Audience

**Who:** Local service business owners—roofers, HVAC, plumbers, electricians, cleaners, handymen, landscapers, small contractors

**Where to find them:**
- Nextdoor neighborhood groups (they complain there!)
- Local Facebook groups for trades
- Google Maps (literally—the same prospects Tristan already targets)
- HomeAdvisor/Thumbtack (they're paying for leads but missing organic growth)
- Chamber of Commerce meetings
- Industry meetups (roofers associations, contractor guilds)

## Your Advantage

Tristan is uniquely positioned to dominate this space because:

1. **Existing pipeline**: Already finding and contacting these exact businesses daily for web dev—he knows their pain intimately
2. **Distribution advantage**: Every web dev lead becomes a ShowUp trial, every ShowUp user becomes a web dev lead—flywheel effect
3. **Skin in the game**: His dad/youth pastor/local contacts in Florida are small business owners—ideal beta testers and case studies
4. **Teen founder angle**: At 18, he becomes the "young entrepreneur helping blue-collar businesses" media story—free PR hook
5. **AgencySpotter knowledge**: Understands how agencies position themselves—can reverse-engineer for local biz market
6. **StageVibe learnings**: Experience building for musicians means he knows how to serve creators/businesses, not just code features
7. **Local Florida focus**: Can own one market first (Bradenton/Sarasota) before expanding—becomes the local hero

He doesn't just understand the tool—he understands the person using it. That's the edge.
