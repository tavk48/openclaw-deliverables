# BUSKER & STREET PERFORMER SIGN RESEARCH
**Date:** 2026-02-07 16:20 EST 
**Context:** Supporting StageVibe "GloVibe" LED concept

## KEY INSIGHT FROM r/BUSKING
"Your Social Media / Website / Ways for people to check you out" — crucial element

**Busker Sign Best Practices:**
- Signs referring to money can get performers cited for "panhandling" or "begging" in some jurisdictions
- Must be legible from across the street
- Big, thick, block lettering in blue or black with highlighting
- People look at performer, not money in case — signs must be obvious

**Implication for GloVibe:**
- Frame it as "connect with me" not "give me money"
- QR code = connection tool, not just tip jar
- "Scan for setlist + tips" vs "TIPS HERE"

## COMPETITOR: CustomNeon.com
- Sells DJ/Band neon signs ($100-300+)
- LED neon, not battery-powered
- Fixed installation, not portable
- Positioned as "light up gigs and live shows"

**Gap:** No portable, battery-powered, musician-specific QR code integration

---

## MARKET VALIDATION
Busking/street performing communities exist on:
- r/Busking (active community)
- r/StreetPerformers
- TheBrokeBackpacker busking guide

These are StageVibe's early adopters — already comfortable with public acknowledgment of tips.
