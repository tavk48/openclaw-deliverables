## PROBLEM AGITATION

**Headline:**
The Average Sale Needs 5+ Follow-Ups. Most People Quit After 1.

**Body:**
Here's what happens when prospects ghost after a demo:

- **Hour 1:** You think "they're busy, they'll reply"
- **Day 2:** Still nothing. You draft a follow-up email. Delete it. Rewrite it. Delete it again.
- **Day 5:** You send something generic. It lands in their promotions tab.
- **Day 12:** You forget about them entirely.
- **Day 45:** A competitor closes the deal.

Meanwhile, you lost revenue. Lost confidence. And probably swore you'd "get better at follow-up."

**You're not lazy. You're human.**

Good follow-up isn't a skill. It's a system.

## SOLUTION

**Headline:**
What If Follow-Up Just... Happened?

**Body:**
Ghostline is AI that handles your entire post-demo sequence.

**How it works:**

1. **Connect your calendar** — Ghostline knows when your demos happen
2. **Choose your channels** — Email, SMS, LinkedIn, or all three
3. **Let it run** — Perfectly-timed messages send automatically
4. **Get the alert** — When they're warm again, you get pinged to call

**Every message is personalized.** Not "Hi [FIRST_NAME]"

Ghostline reads your demo notes and crafts messages that reference actual conversations, pain points, and next steps.

## FEATURES

**Multi-Channel Sequences**
Email → SMS → LinkedIn → Repeat. Ghostline rotates channels based on your prospect's response patterns. Some people check texts. Others live in LinkedIn.

**Smart Timing**
Messages send when prospects are most likely to respond — not at 11:47 PM because that's when you remembered.

**Demo Note Integration**
Ghostline scans your calendar notes and weaves specific details into follow-ups. "You mentioned wanting to launch before Q2." Not "Just checking in!"

**Warm Alerts**
When a prospect opens emails, clicks links, or replies, Ghostline alerts you instantly. That's your window to call.

**Close-The-Loop Templates**
Pre-built sequences for common situations:
- Post-demo ghosted
- Proposal sent, no response
- "Let me think about it"
- Referral follow-up
- Re-engaging old leads

## SOCIAL PROOF

**Headline:**
Built by Someone Who Lost $50K to Bad Follow-Up

**Body:**
"I closed 0% of my cold calls last year. Not because my demos were bad — because I was terrible at following up. I built Ghostline to fix my own problem. Now I can't imagine running my business without it."

— Tristan Velez, Freelance Web Developer

**Additional quotes to collect:**
- "I finally stopped feeling guilty about my CRM"
- "Ghostline is my most consistent sales rep"
- "Replied to a 6-month-old lead yesterday. Booked a call. Still in shock."

## FAQ

**How is this different from HubSpot or Mailchimp?**
Those are general marketing tools. Ghostline is built specifically for freelancers who close deals via demos and consultations. The sequences, timing logic, and integrations are purpose-built for your workflow.

**Do I need to write the messages?**
Yes and no. Ghostline generates drafts based on your demo notes. You review and approve before they send — or set it to auto-send for trusted contacts.

**What if I want to pause a sequence?**
One click. You control everything.

**Does this integrate with my calendar?**
Yes — Google Calendar, Outlook, Calendly. Ghostline knows when demos happen and starts sequences automatically.
