## 💡 IDEA #1: StageVibe "Gig Check-in" Challenge

**THE PRODUCT:** TikTok/IG Reels campaign where musicians post clips using StageVibe at gigs

**THE PROBLEM:** Musicians struggle to promote themselves consistently + lack social proof content

**WHY IT GOES VIRAL:**
- Musicians love showing behind-the-scenes content
- Gives them an excuse + incentive to post
- Creates user-generated content for StageVibe
- $100 prize is cheap customer acquisition

**EXECUTION STEPS:**
1. Create simple TikTok/Reels brief template (what to film)
2. Announce challenge on StageVibe social accounts
3. Every participant gets featured on your account
4. Weekly $100 drawing for participants
5. Document "winners" to create more social proof

**TIMELINE:** 2 hours setup, $100 budget, run 1 week
**POTENTIAL REACH:** 500+ musicians if 10% of followers participate

## 💡 IDEA #2: "Website Roast" Series for Web Dev

**THE PRODUCT:** Free 2-minute loom video audit of bad local business websites

**THE PROBLEM:** Cold emails get ignored; personalized video gets watched

**WHY IT GOES VIRAL:**
- Post best/worst ones (anonymized) on TikTok
- "Local biz roast series" hook
- 10-15% reply rate on personalized video vs 0.5% on cold email
- Builds authority + entertains

**EXECUTION STEPS:**
1. Find 5 prospects via Google Maps (search: "plumber Bradenton")
2. Record 2-min screen captures: "5 things killing your Google ranking"
3. Send via email + text with Loom link
4. Post best clips as TikTok content
5. Follow up after 3 days with "Want me to fix #1 for free?"

**TIMELINE:** 1 hour to record 5 videos
**TARGET:** 10 audits/week → expect 1-2 conversions

## 💡 IDEA #3: "Setlist Optimizer" AI Tool for StageVibe

**THE PRODUCT:** Build a simple AI tool that analyzes song history + crowd tips to suggest optimal setlist order

**THE PROBLEM:** Musicians guess at setlist order; no data-driven approach

**WHY IT GOES VIRAL:**
- Unique value prop: "AI knows what your crowd wants"
- Document build in public → dev community buzz
- Tie to StageVibe platform → funnel into main product

**BUILD SPECS:**
- Complexity: 2-3 days (MVP)
- Stack: Next.js + OpenAI API
- MVP: Upload CSV of past gigs → get ranked suggestions

**MONETIZATION:** Free tool → email capture → StageVibe signup

## 💡 IDEA #4: Local SEO Play for Web Dev Inbound

**THE PRODUCT:** "Best [Business Type] in [City]" roundup blog posts

**EXAMPLE:** "Top 10 Plumbers in Bradenton (2025)"

**THE PROBLEM:** Outbound is exhausting; you need inbound leads

**WHY IT GOES VIRAL:**
- Ranks on Google for "best plumbers Bradenton"
- Businesses WANT to be on these lists
- Some businesses listed will want their own site
- Positions you as local authority

**EXECUTION STEPS:**
1. Pick niche: plumbers, electricians, HVAC
2. Research 10 businesses, write 500-word post
3. Reach out to each: "You're featured! Want a link to your own site?"
